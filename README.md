## Overview of Project:
We built a HTML page that extracts and displays data from a json.file with the help of filters that makes the search easier.

## Results: 
First we have an introduction to the topic of the search. These make people be involved with the topic.

Secondly, we have the data gathered and ready to be filtered out. We have 5 filters each of which work independently, i.e., you can use 1 or all of them at the same time. Without the need of a button, data will be filtered automatically to display exactly what the user is asking for.

## Summary: 
The drawback I see is that there needs to be a json.file attached with the information. I would be a lot nicer if it could depend from a SQL database as those would update automatically. If that was something feasible, I would already this is a great opportunity to be more efficient at doing somethiing at my recent job.

Coming back as to how to improve this, I would put the filters horizontally right at the top of the list; this would make them easier to see without having to scroll down. It would also be nice to have dropdowns. I don´t know us states, and having a dropdown would make it easier to select.

One drawback is that it can´t be filter through Duration nor key words found on comments.
